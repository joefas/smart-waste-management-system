# Smart Waste Management System

## Overview

The **Smart Waste Management System** is designed to revolutionize urban waste collection by utilizing IoT (Internet of Things) and machine learning to optimize routes, monitor waste levels, and improve the efficiency of garbage collection services. The system aims to reduce costs, minimize environmental impact, and provide real-time data analytics for city waste management.

## Features

- **Smart Bins**: IoT-enabled sensors to monitor waste levels in real-time.
- **Route Optimization**: Dynamic route planning based on real-time data to reduce fuel consumption and operational time.
- **Data Analytics**: Provide insights on waste patterns, collection efficiency, and environmental impact.
- **Alerts and Notifications**: Automated alerts to inform about bin status (full, empty, or malfunctioning).
- **User Interface**: Web and mobile dashboards to monitor and manage the system.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python, Node.js
- **Frontend**: React.js, HTML/CSS
- **Database**: MySQL, MongoDB
- **IoT Integration**: MQTT, Arduino, or Raspberry Pi for sensor data
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow (for route optimization and prediction models)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/joefas/smart-waste-management-system.git
    cd smart-waste-management-system
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    - For the backend (assuming it's in Python):
      ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```

    - For the frontend:
      ```bash
      npm install
      ```

3. **Run the application**:
    - Backend:
      ```bash
      python app.py
      ```

    - Frontend:
      ```bash
      npm start
      ```

## Usage

1. **IoT Setup**: Ensure that IoT devices (e.g., sensors on the bins) are configured and sending data to the backend.
2. **Web Dashboard**: Access the web interface to monitor waste levels and optimize routes.
